# Building Native Images in Java with GraalVM

In this tutorial, we will explore the exciting and powerful process of creating native executables in Java using GraalVM. Starting with a basic example, we will walk through the process of building a native executable from an application that does not contain any dynamic features. Once we have a handle on the basics, we will then move on to utilizing reflection, which requires the specification of all potential classes to be included in the binary.
